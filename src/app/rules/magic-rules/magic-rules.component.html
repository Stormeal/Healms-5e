        <p>
          Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell. <br />This
          section provides the rules for casting Spells. Different character Classes have
          distinctive ways of learning and preparing their Spells, and Monsters use Spells in unique
          ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="display-3" style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold">What is a spell</h1>
        <p>
          A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that
          suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In Casting a Spell, a
          character carefully plucks at the Invisible strands of Raw Magic suffusing the world, pins
          them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then
          releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.
          <br />
          Spells can be Versatile tools, Weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo
          it, impose or remove Conditions , drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.
          <br />
          Uncounted thousands of Spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s
          History, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling
          spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might
          someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and Wisdom to do so.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="display-3" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold">Spell Level</h1>
        <p>
          Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how
          powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) Magic Missile at 1st level and the
          earth--shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful Spells that characters can cast
          almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster
          must be to use that spell.
          <br />
          Spell Level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to
          be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th--level spell.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="display-3" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold">
          Known and Prepared Spells
        </h1>
        <p>
          Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind,
          or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few Classes, including
          bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of Spells they know that are always fixed in
          mind. The same thing is true of many magic--using Monsters. Other spellcasters, such as
          clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing Spells. This process varies for
          different Classes, as detailed in their descriptions.
          <br />
          In every case, the number of Spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time
          depends on the character’s level.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="display-3" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold">Spell Slots</h1>
        <p>
          Regardless of how many Spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a
          limited number of Spells before Resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling
          its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-- level
          Spells are even more so. Thus, each Spellcasting class’s description (except that of the
          warlock) includes a table showing how many Spell Slots of each Spell Level a character can
          use at each character level. For example, the 3rd--level Wizard Umara has four 1st--level
          Spell Slots and two 2nd--level slots.
          <br /><br />
          When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher,
          effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of
          a certain size—small for a 1st--level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A
          1st--level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th--level spell fits only in a
          9th--level slot. So when Umara casts Magic Missile, a 1st--level spell, she spends one of
          her four 1st--level slots and has three remaining.
          <br /><br />
          Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended Spell Slots.
          <br /><br />
          Some characters and Monsters have Special Abilities that let them cast Spells without
          using Spell Slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a Warlock
          who chooses certain Eldritch Invocations, and a Pit Fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast
          Spells in such a way.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1 class="display-3" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold">
          Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
        </h1>
        <p>
          When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell,
          the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts Magic
          Missile using one of her 2nd--level slots, that Magic Missile is 2nd level. Effectively,
          the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.
          <br /><br />
          Some Spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure Wounds, have more powerful Effects when cast
          at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.
        </p>

        <h1 class="display-3" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold">
          Casting in Armor
        </h1>
        <p>
          Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for Spellcasting, you must be
          proficient with the armor you are wearing to Cast a Spell. You are otherwise too
          distracted and physically hampered by your armor for Spellcasting.
